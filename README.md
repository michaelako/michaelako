# Hi, I'm Michaela
## Who I am:
I'm a Duke Computer Science/Psychology alumna ('22)  currently working in a Software Engineer role. I have experience in the full stack, but am currently focused on improving my UX/UI skills!
## What you can find here:
Past projects, test runs, and times I've tried something new
## My interests:
I'm very interested in the intersection of Mental Health and Technology; specifically how technology can better be used to improve our mental healthcare and broader wellness.
As an undergraduate, I focused on psychological research and published two behavioral science articles. Outside of work, I love to dance, do yoga, and spend time in the sunshine ðŸŒ„
